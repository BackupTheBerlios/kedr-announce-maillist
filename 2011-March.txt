Hello,

KEDR 0.2 has been released. 
You can get it here: http://prdownload.berlios.de/kedr/kedr-0.2.tar.bz2

This release provides several enhancements and various fixes compared 
to version 0.1. Most significant changes:

    * Tracing subsystem has been completely rewritten to be more versatile and reliable even on SMP systems.

    * A memory leak detector (LeakCheck) has been implemented.

    * It is now possible to restrict fault simulation to particular areas in the target module (if the kernel provides reliable stack traces).

    * Several fixes have been made for KEDR to be able to work on the versions 2.6.37 and 2.6.38 of the kernel.

    * Call monitoring for 20 more functions is now supported. Support for fault simulation for many of these functions as well as for vmalloc() group has also been provided.

    * The issues concerning parallel builds (bug #017731) have been fixed.

See ChangeLog for detailed information about the changes in this version.
