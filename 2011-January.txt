Hello,

kedr_leak_check version 0.1.3 has been released. 

As its name implies, "kedr_leak_check" is a KEDR-based tool to check kernel  modules for memory leaks. Unlike call monitoring facilities provided by KEDR, this tool does not use trace or anything like that. It silently analyzes the calls to more than 25 memory allocation and deallocation functions and uses files in debugfs to display the results: the adresses and lengths of the leaked memory blocks along with the stack traces of appropriate allocation calls.

See Readme.txt included in the archive with "kedr_leak_check" for details.

This is a maintenance release. 

Enhancements:
- The tool was revisited to identify allocations with the same call stack and to output only the latest of them along with their count, which makes the tool's output more readable and requires less memory to maintain the output buffer. 
- Performance was improved: processing of large number of deallocations (e.g. deallocation of inode and dentry structures) is now faster.

Regards,
Eugene
