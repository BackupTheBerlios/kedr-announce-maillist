Subject: [Kedr-announce] KEDR 0.3
Message-ID: <E1QXWD1-0001IB-00.dame_eugene-mail-ru@f28.mail.ru>

Hello,

KEDR 0.3 has been released. 
You can get it here: http://prdownload.berlios.de/kedr/kedr-0.3.tar.bz2

Project home page: http://kedr.berlios.de/

This release provides several enhancements and various fixes compared to version 0.2.1. Most significant changes:

    * Handling of intercepted function calls has been revisited to allow doing several kinds of analysis at the same time (e.g. performing fault 
simulation and memory leak detection simultaneously). 
    * The components responsible for fault simulation are now decoupled from call monitoring (call tracing) facilities and can be used independently if necessary.
    * Several enhancements and fixes have been applied to the trace capturing utility.
    * Stack trace-related API has been revisited and simplified. If the kernel provides reliable stack traces, the API works now even if save_stack_trace() is not available.
    * Handling of allocations and frees in the memory leak detector is now deferred via a work queue. This allows to significantly reduce the time spent with locks held.

See ChangeLog for detailed information about the changes in this version. 

Regards,
Eugene
