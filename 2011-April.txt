Subject: [Kedr-announce] KEDR 0.2.1
Message-ID: <E1QA0CB-0003OV-00.dame_eugene-mail-ru@f203.mail.ru>

Hello,

 KEDR 0.2.1 has been released. 
 You can get it here: http://prdownload.berlios.de/kedr/kedr-0.2.1.tar.bz2

The most significant change in this release is the enhancement of build system. It is now possible to build KEDR for a kernel different from the
one running on the build machine. It is also possible to build it for a different system (e.g. for Chromium OS, x86-generic). 

The usage instructions are available in KEDR Wiki:
http://openfacts2.berlios.de/wikien/index.php/BerliosProject:KEDR

See ChangeLog for detailed information about the changes in this version.

 Regards,
 Eugene
